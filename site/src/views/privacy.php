    <h2>Server Log Files</h2>
    <p>
        The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:

    <ul>
        <li>Browser type and browser version</li>

        <li>Referrer URL</li>

    </p>

    <h2>SSL Encryption</h2>
    <p>
        This site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as the requests you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock icon in your browser line.
        When SSL encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
    </p>
